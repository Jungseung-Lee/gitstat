gitstat is a GPL'd, web-based statistics and monitoring system for git, 
a version control system which is best known for linux kernel. 
gitstat retrieves development status and shows various statistics 
information like how many changesets were merged per day or month, 
how many people have submitted changeset per specified tag(version), 
how long does it take for specified tag(version)...etc.

gitstat also features a monitoring interface. Users can select 
interested linux kernel directory and get notification if any 
changeset merged modifies file to that directory. 
This is a very handy feature for linux users and developers.

gitstat was derived from kfm(kernel feature monitor) which 
was originally developed by Keun-Sik Lim and Sang-Bae Lee of 
Samsung Electronics and currently maintained and developed by 
Jeong-Seung Lee and Soon-Son Kwon(Shawn) of Samsung Electronics.
The original idea of gitstat came from Jon Corbet of lwn.net
when he analyzed the git tree and Greg KH when he presented
similar status report at OLS2007.

gitstat is still in early stage and requires much improvements.
Suggestions, bug reports, patches are always welcomed. 
Anyone interested can freely download the source code or 
participate at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitstat .
